The deb package is nowhere to be found using apt for kali linux.
The workaround is as follows.

```
# First update the repo
sudo apt update
# Install Snapd
sudo apt install snapd
# Do not forget to enable snapd and apparmor
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd apparmor
# Once its enabled install lxd package
sudo snap install lxd
# Logout and log back in to your account.
# I know. I know. That part kinda sucks. 
# The following steps sucks even more
# For whatever reason, the snap location is not getting
# added to the env variable. Add all the necessary manually
# First check whether snap is added to the path.
# The path should be /snap/bin
sudo env | grep PATH
# If not added, you will have to add the paths manually.
export PATH=$PATH:/snap/bin 
# That one just above is just a temporary solution. 
# You have two options. Either add the export path in the 
# /etc/bash.bashrc file or do the following. Both are ugly way
# to do it.
echo 'alias lxd="sudo /snap/bin/lxd"' >> ~/.bash_aliases
echo 'alias lxc="sudo /snap/bin/lxc"' >> ~/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bash_aliases
# Don't forget to add sudo infront of the aliases for lxc and lxd
# You will understand what I mean when your ignorant ass doesn't 
# add it and tries to call sudo on it.
```
This should be enough to install lxd and lxc
