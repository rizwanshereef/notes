## LXC/LXD Deep Dive

Self contained execution environment with their own isolated cpu, memory, block IO, and network resources.
They share the kernel makes very efficient.

LXC is a linux only hypervisor

LXC : Linux Container
LXD : Linux Container Daemon

Docker provides application containers -- self contained application
LXC contains machine containers -- More like VM

LXD : Focuses on a self-contained OS userspace created with its isolated infrastructure. LXC is the userspace interface for the linux kernel containment features and manages the kernel namespaces,Apparmor and SELinux Profiles, chroots and all ther kernel relate fucntionality.

LXC relies more on the OS features for networking and storage than docker does.

LXD is the container's "hypervisor" consisting of the daemon, lxd, the client, lxc and the possibly the nova-lxd OpenStack Plugin if you want or need it.

Docker engine wraps applicatios with a self contained filesystem instead of a base userspace image like so that we can treat the whole container are as single process in the docker engine.

docker is designed to be stateless and have version tracking features and there are lot of features.

lxc is api driven

lxd is fast, efficient and secure

lxd and docker can run side by side
also docker can run inside lxd

possible to run lxc inside another lxc

lxc responds to restful api.
